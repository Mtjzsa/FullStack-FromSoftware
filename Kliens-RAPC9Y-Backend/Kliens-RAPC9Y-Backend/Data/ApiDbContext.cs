Commanding his knights, he led the Lords to victory and oversaw the Age of Fire. Despite being partially bequeathed to the Four Kings and Seath the Scaleless, his soul remains a powerful thing indeed.\r\n\r\nAround a thousand years prior to the start of the Dark Souls game events, Gwyn sacrificed himself to link the First Flame. His reasons for doing so are disputed, but what is certain is that his principal motivation was to postpone the end of the Age of Fire. He was succeeded by his children: his firstborn, the banished God of War who lost his status as a deity; his daughter Gwynevere, the Queen of Sunlight; and his lastborn Gwyndolin, his \"repulsive [and] frail\" son who Gwyn raised as a daughter due to Gwyndolin's affinity for the Moon.\r\n\r\nIt will come as no surprise to anyone who has spoken to Kingseeker Frampt, Darkstalker Kaathe, or the illusion of Gwynevere, that Lord Gwyn is the final boss of the game, and that it is the Chosen Undead's goal to either succeed him and end further Undead sacrifices, or start the Age of Dark: the apparent age of Humanity. Lord Gwyn can be fought after acquiring all Lord Souls and Lord Soul Shards and returning them to the Lordvessel at Firelink Altar, which will grant access to the Kiln of the First Flame.

This is evidenced by his presence in Drangleic, at Heide's Tower of Flame, where we can speculate he might have fled with Gwynevere. There is also the matter of his armour being present in Archdragon Peak, suggesting he followed Gwyn's Firstborn after his betrayal, with some suggesting he even shed his armour and body to become a dragon – not least as the Nameless King echoes the Ornstein and Smough boss fight in absorbing the lightning of his stormdrake, The King of Storm."},
